# Minitunes build instructions

## Prerequisites
To compile Minitunes you need:
- Qt4: http://qt.nokia.com. The following Qt modules are needed: network, xml, phonon, sql
- TagLib: http://developer.kde.org/~wheeler/taglib.html

On a Debian or Ubuntu system just type:
sudo apt-get install build-essential qt4-dev-tools libphonon-dev libtag1-dev libqt4-sql-sqlite

## A word on Phonon on Linux
To be able to actually listen to music you need a working Phonon setup.
As of 2010, Linux distributions are not doing a great job of automatically setting up Phonon.
For example Ubuntu is automatically installing the Xine backend, while obviously Gstreamer
would be a much better choice for a GNOME desktop.

## Compiling
Building is fairly easy. Just run:
    $ qmake
and then:
    $ make

## Running
./build/target/minitunes

## Installing on Linux
You could run
    $ sudo make install
But installing stuff this way is not recommended.
