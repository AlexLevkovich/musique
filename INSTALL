# Build instructions

## Prerequisites
To compile Musique you need:
- Qt4: http://qt.digia.com. The following Qt modules are needed: network, xml, phonon, sql
- TagLib: http://taglib.github.io

On a Debian or Ubuntu system type:
sudo apt-get install build-essential qt4-dev-tools libphonon-dev libtag1-dev libqt4-sql-sqlite

## Compiling
Run:
    $ qmake
and then:
    $ make

## Running
./build/target/musique

## A word about Phonon on Linux
To be able to actually listen to music you need a working Phonon setup.
Please don't contact me about this, ask for help on your distribution support channels.

## Installing on Linux
Run:
    $ sudo make install
This is for packagers. End users should not install applications in this way.
